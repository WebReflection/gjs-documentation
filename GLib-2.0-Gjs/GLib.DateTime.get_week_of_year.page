function get_week_of_year(): Number(gint) {

  </code></synopsis>
  <p>Returns the ISO 8601 week number for the week containing <code>datetime</code>.
The ISO 8601 week number is the same for every day of the week (from
Moday through Sunday).  That can produce some unusual results
(described below).</p>  <p>The first week of the year is week 1.  This is the week that contains
the first Thursday of the year.  Equivalently, this is the first week
that has more than 4 of its days falling within the calendar year.</p>  <p>The value 0 is never returned by this function.  Days contained
within a year but occurring before the first ISO 8601 week of that
year are considered as being contained in the last week of the
previous year.  Similarly, the final days of a calendar year may be
considered as being part of the first ISO 8601 week of the next year
if 4 or more days of that week are contained within the new year.</p>
  <p>Since 2.26</p>
