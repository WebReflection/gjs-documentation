  <p>This section introduces the GVariant type system. It is based, in
large part, on the D-Bus type system, with two major changes and
some minor lifting of restrictions. The
[D-Bus specification](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html),
therefore, provides a significant amount of
information that is useful when working with GVariant.</p>  <p>The first major change with respect to the D-Bus type system is the
introduction of maybe (or "nullable") types.  Any type in GVariant can be
converted to a maybe type, in which case, "nothing" (or "null") becomes a
valid value.  Maybe types have been added by introducing the
character "m" to type strings.</p>  <p>The second major change is that the GVariant type system supports the
concept of "indefinite types" -- types that are less specific than
the normal types found in D-Bus.  For example, it is possible to speak
of "an array of any type" in GVariant, where the D-Bus type system
would require you to speak of "an array of integers" or "an array of
strings".  Indefinite types have been added by introducing the
characters "*", "?" and "r" to type strings.</p>  <p>Finally, all arbitrary restrictions relating to the complexity of
types are lifted along with the restriction that dictionary entries
may only appear nested inside of arrays.</p>  <p>Just as in D-Bus, GVariant types are described with strings ("type
strings").  Subject to the differences mentioned above, these strings
are of the same form as those found in DBus.  Note, however: D-Bus
always works in terms of messages and therefore individual type
strings appear nowhere in its interface.  Instead, "signatures"
are a concatenation of the strings of the type of each argument in a
message.  GVariant deals with single values directly so GVariant type
strings always describe the type of exactly one value.  This means
that a D-Bus signature string is generally not a valid GVariant type
string -- except in the case that it is the signature of a message
containing exactly one argument.</p>  <p>An indefinite type is similar in spirit to what may be called an
abstract type in other type systems.  No value can exist that has an
indefinite type as its type, but values can exist that have types
that are subtypes of indefinite types.  That is to say,
<link xref="GLib.Variant.get_type"/> will never return an indefinite type, but
calling <link xref="GLib.Variant.is_of_type"/> with an indefinite type may return
<code>true</code>.  For example, you cannot have a value that represents "an
array of no particular type", but you can have an "array of integers"
which certainly matches the type of "an array of no particular type",
since "array of integers" is a subtype of "array of no particular
type".</p>  <p>This is similar to how instances of abstract classes may not
directly exist in other type systems, but instances of their
non-abstract subtypes may.  For example, in GTK, no object that has
the type of #GtkBin can exist (since #GtkBin is an abstract class),
but a #GtkWindow can certainly be instantiated, and you would say
that the #GtkWindow is a #GtkBin (since #GtkWindow is a subclass of
#GtkBin).</p>  <p>## GVariant Type Strings</p>  <p>A GVariant type string can be any of the following:</p>  <p>- any basic type string (listed below)</p>  <p>- "v", "r" or "*"</p>  <p>- one of the characters 'a' or 'm', followed by another type string</p>  <p>- the character '(', followed by a concatenation of zero or more other
  type strings, followed by the character ')'</p>  <p>- the character '{', followed by a basic type string (see below),
  followed by another type string, followed by the character '}'</p>  <p>A basic type string describes a basic type (as per
<link xref="GLib.is_basic"/>) and is always a single character in length.
The valid basic type strings are "b", "y", "n", "q", "i", "u", "x", "t",
"h", "d", "s", "o", "g" and "?".</p>  <p>The above definition is recursive to arbitrary depth. "aaaaai" and
"(ui(nq((y)))s)" are both valid type strings, as is
"a(aa(ui)(qna{ya(yd)}))".</p>  <p>The meaning of each of the characters is as follows:
- `b`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BOOLEAN; a boolean value.
- `y`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BYTE; a byte.
- `n`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT16; a signed 16 bit integer.
- `q`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT16; an unsigned 16 bit integer.
- `i`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT32; a signed 32 bit integer.
- `u`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT32; an unsigned 32 bit integer.
- `x`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT64; a signed 64 bit integer.
- `t`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT64; an unsigned 64 bit integer.
- `h`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_HANDLE; a signed 32 bit value
  that, by convention, is used as an index into an array of file
  descriptors that are sent alongside a D-Bus message.
- `d`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE; a double precision
  floating point value.
- `s`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING; a string.
- `o`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_OBJECT_PATH; a string in the form
  of a D-Bus object path.
- `g`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING; a string in the form of
  a D-Bus type signature.
- `?`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BASIC; an indefinite type that
  is a supertype of any of the basic types.
- `v`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT; a container type that
  contain any other type of value.
- `a`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean an array of that
  type; the type string "ai", for example, is the type of an array of
  signed 32-bit integers.
- `m`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean a "maybe", or
  "nullable", version of that type; the type string "ms", for example,
  is the type of a value that maybe contains a string, or maybe contains
  nothing.
- `()`: used to enclose zero or more other concatenated type strings to
  create a tuple type; the type string "(is)", for example, is the type of
  a pair of an integer and a string.
- `r`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_TUPLE; an indefinite type that is
  a supertype of any tuple type, regardless of the number of items.
- `{}`: used to enclose a basic type string concatenated with another type
  string to create a dictionary entry type, which usually appears inside of
  an array to form a dictionary; the type string "a{sd}", for example, is
  the type of a dictionary that maps strings to double precision floating
  point values.</p>  <p>  The first type (the basic type) is the key type and the second type is
  the value type. The reason that the first type is restricted to being a
  basic type is so that it can easily be hashed.
- `*`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_ANY; the indefinite type that is
  a supertype of all types.  Note that, as with all type strings, this
  character represents exactly one type. It cannot be used inside of tuples
  to mean "any number of items".</p>  <p>Any type string of a container that contains an indefinite type is,
itself, an indefinite type. For example, the type string "a*"
(corresponding to %G_VARIANT_TYPE_ARRAY) is an indefinite type
that is a supertype of every array type. "(*s)" is a supertype
of all tuples that contain exactly two items where the second
item is a string.</p>  <p>"a{?*}" is an indefinite type that is a supertype of all arrays
containing dictionary entries where the key is any basic type and
the value is any type at all.  This is, by definition, a dictionary,
so this type string corresponds to %G_VARIANT_TYPE_DICTIONARY. Note
that, due to the restriction that the key of a dictionary entry must
be a basic type, "{**}" is not a valid type string.</p>
