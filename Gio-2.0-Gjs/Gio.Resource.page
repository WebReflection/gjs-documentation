  <title>Gio.Resource</title>
  <synopsis><code>
const Gio = imports.gi.Gio;

let resource = new Gio.Resource();
  </code></synopsis>
  <p>Applications and libraries often contain binary or textual data that is
really part of the application, rather than user data. For instance
#GtkBuilder .ui files, splashscreen images, GMenu markup xml, CSS files,
icons, etc. These are often shipped as files in `$datadir/appname`, or
manually included as literal strings in the code.</p>  <p>The <link xref="Gio.Resource"/> API and the [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] program
provide a convenient and efficient alternative to this which has some nice properties. You
maintain the files as normal files, so its easy to edit them, but during the build the files
are combined into a binary bundle that is linked into the executable. This means that loading
the resource files are efficient (as they are already in memory, shared with other instances) and
simple (no need to check for things like I/O errors or locate the files in the filesystem). It
also makes it easier to create relocatable applications.</p>  <p>Resource files can also be marked as compressed. Such files will be included in the resource bundle
in a compressed form, but will be automatically uncompressed when the resource is used. This
is very useful e.g. for larger text files that are parsed once (or rarely) and then thrown away.</p>  <p>Resource files can also be marked to be preprocessed, by setting the value of the
`preprocess` attribute to a comma-separated list of preprocessing options.
The only options currently supported are:</p>  <p>`xml-stripblanks` which will use the xmllint command
to strip ignorable whitespace from the xml file. For this to work,
the `XMLLINT` environment variable must be set to the full path to
the xmllint executable, or xmllint must be in the `PATH`; otherwise
the preprocessing step is skipped.</p>  <p>`to-pixdata` which will use the gdk-pixbuf-pixdata command to convert
images to the GdkPixdata format, which allows you to create pixbufs directly using the data inside
the resource file, rather than an (uncompressed) copy if it. For this, the gdk-pixbuf-pixdata
program must be in the PATH, or the `GDK_PIXBUF_PIXDATA` environment variable must be
set to the full path to the gdk-pixbuf-pixdata executable; otherwise the resource compiler will
abort.</p>  <p>Resource bundles are created by the [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] program
which takes an xml file that describes the bundle, and a set of files that the xml references. These
are combined into a binary resource bundle.</p>  <p>An example resource description:
|[
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;gresources&gt;
  &lt;gresource prefix="/org/gtk/Example"&gt;
    &lt;file&gt;data/splashscreen.png&lt;/file&gt;
    &lt;file compressed="true"&gt;dialog.ui&lt;/file&gt;
    &lt;file preprocess="xml-stripblanks"&gt;menumarkup.xml&lt;/file&gt;
  &lt;/gresource&gt;
&lt;/gresources&gt;
]|</p>  <p>This will create a resource bundle with the following files:
|[
/org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png
/org/gtk/Example/dialog.ui
/org/gtk/Example/menumarkup.xml
]|</p>  <p>Note that all resources in the process share the same namespace, so use java-style
path prefixes (like in the above example) to avoid conflicts.</p>  <p>You can then use [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] to compile the xml to a
binary bundle that you can load with <link xref="Gio.resource_load"/>. However, its more common to use the --generate-source and
--generate-header arguments to create a source file and header to link directly into your application.</p>  <p>Once a <link xref="Gio.Resource"/> has been created and registered all the data in it can be accessed globally in the process by
using API calls like <link xref="Gio.resources_open_stream"/> to stream the data or <link xref="Gio.resources_lookup_data"/> to get a direct pointer
to the data. You can also use uris like "resource:///org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png" with <link xref="Gio.File"/> to access
the resource data.</p>  <p>There are two forms of the generated source, the default version uses the compiler support for constructor
and destructor functions (where available) to automatically create and register the <link xref="Gio.Resource"/> on startup
or library load time. If you pass --manual-register two functions to register/unregister the resource is instead
created. This requires an explicit initialization call in your application/library, but it works on all platforms,
even on the minor ones where this is not available. (Constructor support is available for at least Win32, MacOS and Linux.)</p>  <p>Note that resource data can point directly into the data segment of e.g. a library, so if you are unloading libraries
during runtime you need to be very careful with keeping around pointers to data from a resource, as this goes away
when the library is unloaded. However, in practice this is not generally a problem, since most resource accesses
is for your own resources, and resource data is often used once, during parsing, and then released.</p>
