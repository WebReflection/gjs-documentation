  </code></synopsis>
  <p>Emitted when a change has occured to the menu.</p>  <p>The only changes that can occur to a menu is that items are removed
or added.  Items may not change (except by being removed and added
back in the same location).  This signal is capable of describing
both of those changes (at the same time).</p>  <p>The signal means that starting at the index <code>position</code>, <code>removed</code>
items were removed and <code>added</code> items were added in their place.  If
<code>removed</code> is zero then only items were added.  If <code>added</code> is zero
then only items were removed.</p>  <p>As an example, if the menu contains items a, b, c, d (in that
order) and the signal (2, 1, 3) occurs then the new composition of
the menu will be a, b, _, _, _, d (with each _ representing some
new item).</p>  <p>Signal handlers may query the model (particularly the added items)
and expect to see the results of the modification that is being
reported.  The signal is emitted after the modification.</p>
