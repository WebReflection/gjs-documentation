  </code></synopsis>
  <p>Ensure that interactions with this proxy conform to the given
interface. This is mainly to ensure that malformed data received
from the other peer is ignored. The given <link xref="Gio.DBusInterfaceInfo"/> is
said to be the "expected interface".</p>  <p>The checks performed are:
- When completing a method call, if the type signature of
  the reply message isn't what's expected, the reply is
  discarded and the <link href="../GLib-2.0/GLib.Error.html">GLib.Error</link> is set to <link xref="Gio.IOErrorEnum"/>.invalid_argument.</p>  <p>- Received signals that have a type signature mismatch are dropped and
  a warning is logged via g_warning().</p>  <p>- Properties received via the initial `GetAll()` call or via the
  `::PropertiesChanged` signal (on the
  [org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-properties)
  interface) or set using <link xref="Gio.DBusProxy.set_cached_property"/>
  with a type signature mismatch are ignored and a warning is
  logged via g_warning().</p>  <p>Note that these checks are never done on methods, signals and
properties that are not referenced in the given
<link xref="Gio.DBusInterfaceInfo"/>, since extending a D-Bus interface on the
service-side is not considered an ABI break.</p>
  <p>Since 2.26</p>
