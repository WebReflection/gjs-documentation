SimpleProxyResolver.ignore_hosts: Array(String) (Read / Write)
  </code></synopsis>
  <p>A list of hostnames and IP addresses that the resolver should
allow direct connections to.</p>  <p>Entries can be in one of 4 formats:</p>  <p>- A hostname, such as "example.com", ".example.com", or
  "*.example.com", any of which match "example.com" or
  any subdomain of it.</p>  <p>- An IPv4 or IPv6 address, such as "192.168.1.1",
  which matches only that address.</p>  <p>- A hostname or IP address followed by a port, such as
  "example.com:80", which matches whatever the hostname or IP
  address would match, but only for URLs with the (explicitly)
  indicated port. In the case of an IPv6 address, the address
  part must appear in brackets: "[::1]:443"</p>  <p>- An IP address range, given by a base address and prefix length,
  such as "fe80::/10", which matches any address in that range.</p>  <p>Note that when dealing with Unicode hostnames, the matching is
done against the ASCII form of the name.</p>  <p>Also note that hostname exclusions apply only to connections made
to hosts identified by name, and IP address exclusions apply only
to connections made to hosts identified by address. That is, if
example.com has an address of 192.168.1.1, and the :ignore-hosts list
contains only "192.168.1.1", then a connection to "example.com"
(eg, via a <link xref="Gio.NetworkAddress"/>) will use the proxy, and a connection to
"192.168.1.1" (eg, via a <link xref="Gio.InetSocketAddress"/>) will not.</p>  <p>These rules match the "ignore-hosts"/"noproxy" rules most
commonly used by other applications.</p>
