  <p>Returns the ISO 8601 week-numbering year in which the week containing
<code>datetime</code> falls.</p>  <p>This function, taken together with <link xref="GLib.DateTime.get_week_of_year"/> and
<link xref="GLib.DateTime.get_day_of_week"/> can be used to determine the full ISO
week date on which <code>datetime</code> falls.</p>  <p>This is usually equal to the normal Gregorian year (as returned by
<link xref="GLib.DateTime.get_year"/>), except as detailed below:</p>  <p>For Thursday, the week-numbering year is always equal to the usual
calendar year.  For other days, the number is such that every day
within a complete week (Monday to Sunday) is contained within the
same week-numbering year.</p>  <p>For Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday occurring near the end of the year,
this may mean that the week-numbering year is one greater than the
calendar year (so that these days have the same week-numbering year
as the Thursday occurring early in the next year).</p>  <p>For Friday, Saturaday and Sunday occurring near the start of the year,
this may mean that the week-numbering year is one less than the
calendar year (so that these days have the same week-numbering year
as the Thursday occurring late in the previous year).</p>  <p>An equivalent description is that the week-numbering year is equal to
the calendar year containing the majority of the days in the current
week (Monday to Sunday).</p>  <p>Note that January 1 0001 in the proleptic Gregorian calendar is a
Monday, so this function never returns 0.</p>
