<p class="p">GObject.TYPE_BOXED represents the <span class="code">GBoxed</span> type in the GObject
  type system. You can pass this object to methods taking a
  <span class="link"><a href="GObject.Type.html" title="GObject.Type">GObject.Type</a></span>.
  </p>
<p class="p">The <span class="code">GBoxed</span> type is the base type for all boxed types
  (structures and unions that are not derived from <span class="link"><a href="GObject.Object.html" title="GObject.Object">GObject.Object</a></span>).
  It is not a value type, so it has no representation in gjs as such,
  and it cannot be used in signal arguments or property values directly.
  </p>
<p class="p">Not all JS classes are derived from <span class="code">GBoxed</span>, for example
  they may be new fundamental types. You can check if this is the case
  with <span class="code">GObject.type_is_a(My.StructType, GObject.TYPE_BOXED)</span>.
  </p>
<p class="p">In JS, boxed types are represented with <span class="em">weak wrappers</span>, which
  means that every time a boxed type is converted from C to JS (for example
  as a function call result) a different JS object is created. This means
  that the same underlying C structure can be represented by multiple
  objects at times, so JS boxed wrappers should never be compared by value
  and should not have any JS visible state (for example custom properties),
  because it can be lost at any time.
  </p>
<p class="p">JS boxed wrappers will be garbage collected independently of the underlying
  C structure. Additionally, dependening on the implementation of the
  boxed type (copied value type or reference type), as well as the transfer
  mode of the function from which the value is obtained, the boxed type
  may be a copy of the original C structure, so even C visible state (such
  as method calls that modify the instance) may not affect the right object.
  </p>
<p class="p">In practice, this means that you should treat all boxed types as
  immutable, unless you are sure of the reference-counting semantics or
  you created the structure youself with the appropriate constructor.
